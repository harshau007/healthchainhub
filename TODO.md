## High Priority

These tasks are critical for the core functionality of the application and should be completed first.

- [x] **Set up Next.js with PWA support**

  - Install `next-pwa` and configure `next.config.js`.
  - Create `public/manifest.json` for PWA metadata (e.g., app name, icons, theme color).
  - Add service worker registration to enable offline capabilities and caching.

- [x] **Implement global state management with Zustand**

  - Define a store with TypeScript types for patients, hospital metrics, user roles, and theme settings.
  - Integrate Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time data fetching with automatic updates in the store.
  - Handle SSE connection errors and display toast notifications for user feedback.

- [x] **Define TypeScript interfaces for SSE data**

  - Create interfaces for key data structures: `Patient`, `VitalSigns`, `EHR` (Electronic Health Record), `HMS` (Hospital Management System), `Imaging`, `PatientPortal`, and `HospitalMetrics`.
  - Ensure all components and the state management system use these types for full type safety.

- [ ] **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

  - Create a higher-order component (HOC) `withRole` to restrict page access based on user roles (e.g., admin, hospital staff, patient).
  - Simulate user login for testing different roles.
  - Implement an unauthorized access page for restricted routes.

- [ ] **Develop core screens**

  - **Dashboard**: Display real-time patient vital signs and hospital metrics using shadcn charts.
  - **EHR**: Show patient demographics, medical history, allergies, medications, and lab results.
  - **HMS**: Manage appointments, bed assignments, billing, and admission/discharge data.
  - **Imaging**: List patient imaging records with detailed views.
  - **Patient Portal**: Provide a personalized dashboard for patients to view their data.
  - **Patient Detail**: Create dedicated detail screens for hospital staff and patients.

- [ ] **Integrate notifications**
  - Use the Sonner library for toast notifications (e.g., success/failure of data updates).
  - Set up push notifications for critical updates (optional for initial version).

## Medium Priority

These tasks enhance the user experience and application functionality but are not critical for the initial release.

- [x] **Implement theme toggle**

  - Add a theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.
  - Persist the theme choice across sessions using local storage.

- [x] **Enhance UI/UX with shadcn components**

  - Use shadcn charts to visualize trends and metrics on the dashboard.
  - Implement responsive layouts for all screens using TailwindCSS utilities.

- [ ] **Add form validation for editable fields**

  - Simulate form editing in EHR and HMS screens with client-side validation.
  - Ensure forms are type-safe and handle user input errors gracefully.

- [ ] **Optimize performance**
  - Implement code splitting to reduce initial load times.
  - Use Next.js image optimization for any media assets (e.g., imaging thumbnails).

---

## Low Priority

These tasks are important but can be addressed after the core features are implemented.

- [ ] **Implement offline functionality**

  - Cache critical data (e.g., patient records) for offline access using service workers.
  - Display a user-friendly message when the app is offline.

- [ ] **Add unit and integration tests**

  - Write tests for critical components (e.g., Dashboard, EHR) and state management logic.
  - Use Jest and React Testing Library for comprehensive testing.

- [ ] **Set up CI/CD pipeline**
  - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment to a hosting platform.
  - Enforce code quality with linting and formatting checks (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).

## Optional Enhancements

These tasks are not required for the initial release but can be considered for future iterations to improve the application.

- [ ] **Integrate decentralized storage for imaging**

  - Use IPFS or a similar solution for storing and retrieving medical images securely.
  - Add links or hashes to imaging records for reference.

- [ ] **Implement real user authentication**

  - Replace simulated login with actual authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
  - Manage user sessions and permissions securely with a backend service.

- [ ] **Add multi-language support**

  - Internationalize the application to support multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish).
  - Use a library like `next-i18next` for localization.

- [ ] **Enhance accessibility**
  - Ensure the application meets WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
  - Add keyboard navigation and screen reader support for better usability.
